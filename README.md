"I developed the backend for an IoT-based Battery Management and Monitoring system using JavaScript, Firebase, and Chart.js. The system collects real-time data from IoT devices, stores it in Firebase, and sends it to a web platform. On the website, I implemented interactive data visualization using Chart.js, enabling users to monitor battery performance and analyze trends effectively."
